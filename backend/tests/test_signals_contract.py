"""The embedding-cache contract for the creator_signals split.

Migration 007 moved five columns off `influencers` into `creator_signals`. That
is only safe if the text a creator is embedded as does not change, because the
text is the cache key: a one-character difference re-bills that creator's
vector, and at 1,000 requests/day on the free tier a full re-embed is a
multi-day cost.

These tests pin the contract mechanically rather than relying on the promise in
the migration comment. `_OLD_CORPUS_TEXT` is a literal copy of the string the
single-table version produced, so any drift in `corpus_text` -- a reordered
clause, a changed separator, a dropped field -- fails here.
