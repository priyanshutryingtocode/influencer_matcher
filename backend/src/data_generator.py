"""Seeded Faker profiles for development, demos, and retrieval evaluation.

Creators are described by topic tags, not by a single taxonomy label. A real
creator rarely occupies one niche, and a free-text brief rarely names one
either, so a `niche TEXT NOT NULL` column was a lossy label over a vocabulary
that already existed in the tags. Tags are the whole topical signal now.

Determinism
-----------
Every creator is a pure function of a *slot key*:

    (seed, group, platform, slot)

where `group` is a TAG_GROUPS entry, `platform` a supported platform, and
`slot` the creator's index within that one cell. Each creator draws from its
own `random.Random` seeded with that key, and its own Faker instance seeded
from the same key, so nothing depends on how many creators were generated
before it.

This is not tidiness. With one shared random stream, a creator's values depended
on its position in the emit order, and the emit order depended on
`--balanced-floor`: raising the floor from 3 to 4 rewrote 98% of the corpus.
Since the profile text is the embedding cache key, that re-bills every vector,
and embedding is the expensive step (1,000 requests/day on the free tier). The
property tests in tests/test_data_generator.py pin the behaviour that makes
`--count` and `--balanced-floor` safe to change.

Ids are assigned from a stable sort of the slot key rather than from a
post-generation shuffle, so growing the corpus appends instead of renumbering.
